## DSX Connect API TLS toggle (local dev)
# Set to 'true' to enable HTTPS on port 8586; 'false' for HTTP.
DSXCONNECT_USE_TLS=false

# When DSXCONNECT_USE_TLS=true, provide certificate and key files.
# The repo includes dev certs you can use for quick local testing:
# Prefer shared certs for local dev (also available under shared/deploy/certs)
DSXCONNECT_TLS_CERTFILE=../shared/deploy/certs/dev.localhost.crt
DSXCONNECT_TLS_KEYFILE=../shared/deploy/certs/dev.localhost.key

# Optional: If you want curl/clients to verify TLS with a CA bundle, set this.
# DSXCONNECT_CA_BUNDLE=connectors/framework/deploy/certs/dev.localhost.crt

# Example usage:
#   - Toggle HTTPS on:  set DSXCONNECT_USE_TLS=true
#   - Start API:        python dsx_connect/dsx-connect-api-start.py
#   - Health check:     scripts/curl-dsx-health.sh             # uses DSXCONNECT_USE_TLS
#   - Or override:      DSXCONNECT_USE_TLS=true scripts/curl-dsx-health.sh
