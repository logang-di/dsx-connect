# DSX‑Connect

A modular, integration‑agnostic framework for orchestrating file scanning and remediation at scale.

- Reusable scanning core (queues + workers)
- Pluggable DSX‑Connectors for each repository/service
- Handles on-demand and on-access scanning and remediation
- Supports docker compose and helm/k8s deployment models
- Event‑driven, fault‑tolerant, and cloud‑portable
