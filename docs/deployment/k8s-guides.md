# Kubernetes Guides (per connector)

Connector Helm guides live under each connector repo path:

- connectors/aws_s3/deploy/helm/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_K8S.md
- connectors/azure_blob_storage/deploy/helm/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_K8S.md
- connectors/filesystem/deploy/helm/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_K8S.md
- connectors/google_cloud_storage/deploy/helm/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_K8S.md
- connectors/sharepoint/deploy/helm/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_K8S.md

## Filters (Central Reference)

- To avoid repeating the filter rules in each guide, see Reference → [Filters](../reference/filters.md) for the rsync‑style include/exclude semantics used across all connectors.
